            Based on our evaluation metrics, the optimal models are <strong>XGBoost</strong> and <strong>Bootstrapping</strong>. Both consistently exhibit lower error rates compared to alternatives, although the edge varies slightly depending on the metric. Given my familiarity with XGBoost, it stands out as the preferred choice.

            While additional preprocessing—like standardizing data or reducing features—could refine the results further, the required effort would be substantial. Moreover, simpler models (e.g., AR, LR, SVR, GPR, and Decision Trees) often fall short in capturing intricate patterns, or they are computationally less efficient. In contrast, ensemble methods such as Random Forest and XGBoost, along with Neural Networks, excel at discerning complex relationships. Notably, Random Forest may not handle time dependencies effectively, and Bootstrapping generates independent models that lack collaborative learning.
          </p>
          <p>
            In summary, <strong>XGBoost</strong> emerges as the ideal choice. Although Neural Networks are often favored for larger datasets, both <strong>XGBoost</strong> and <strong>Neural Networks</strong> will be the chosen models.
